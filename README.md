# ling471-SP2021-HW2
Skeleton for HW2 for students to fork.

Forking it will create your own private copy. You can work with that copy and save your progress there.

To submit, copy the python program, renamed YourNetID_assignment2.py, to the repository you created for this class in Assignment 1 (the one where Olga and Yuanhe are collaborators).

#### Remember, your submission needs to be not in your copy of this repository but in the other repository, which you created for Assignment 1!
